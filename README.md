Apologies, I am not General Kenobi. I'm Rachel Shouler - a data driven vintage maven with a :coffee: problem. 

<h2> About Rachel :dizzy: </h2>

I have a passion for data and making sense of it, but it’s not only about manipulating the data. It’s about turning those numbers into persuasive stories that drive business needs – making that data sing! I am also a bit of a problem solver, often using unconventional approaches to problems, or reverse engineering a solution from something that already exists - a real-life MacGyver!

Currently I'm studying Software Engineerig with HyperionDev.  I work in telecommunications, but actively on the lookout for my next career opportunity.

I am a classically trained musician, regularly playing the :trumpet: averagely.  I travel as much as :moneybag: and annual leave allows, with an upcoming trip to Alaska and British Colombia on the books.
